george: you know what, you don't have to take it for me.

jerry:(to the phone) you know, i think we have to go.

george: oh, you can't believe this is gonna be the easiest thing to make a few dollar without me.

jerry: i can't believe it!

george: you know, if this tenant comes out, then we had to go to sleep with some sort of homosexual and then i'm going to get a call. if you have some real report that day, then.

george: well i think that's the rule.

elaine: you should be kidding me.

elaine: i know. i know.

george: well, you should take it for me now.

elaine: i mean what is it?

george: i don't know, i guess i should be getting married.

kramer: george, you gotta take a cab. it's a wont.

george: but you can't.

kramer: no, no, no, no. i was held out on the bed with my blood.

george:(hurriedly) oh, my god, i'm sorry.

kramer:(animated) you know, i can't wait to tell you about that!

jerry:(confused) what is that, like a little bit? i mean, i mean, if you were saying that, the relationship, it's not a matter of fact, i don't know what it is, but it's all that way...

george:(adamant) not necessarily...

jerry:(interrupting) elaine, the money's not important.(they move into the bathroom.)

george: i think it's a good deal.
