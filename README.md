# Udacity_project-tv-script-generation
in this project I used an RNN model with Pytorch framework to create a script generating model,
using the text data (scripts) of simpsons TV show,
the output was intersting, this project made me realize the importance of Natural language processing (NLP), and it's many uses and also the strengths and drawbacks of NLP models
here is the link to the project if you are interested in solving it by yourself:
